Dump is a Coq plugin that exports rasters to graymap PGM files.
Rasters are defined in module CoRN.raster.Raster, as matrices of booleans.

Type make to build this plugin, then 
Require Import CoRN.dump.theories.Loader
from a Coq file where you have rasters to export.
The vernac command defined by the plugin is DumpGrayMap, which takes
as argument the name of a global definition of a raster. It exports
the raster in file plot.pgm, which it will place in the current directory.
See module CoRN.examples.Circle.
